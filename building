To build this application you need the following:
- compiler which supports c++1z.  I used gcc 7.1.  Clang 4.0 should work too.
- Boost libraries (www.boost.org).  I used Boost 1.64
- Poco libraries (pocoproject.org).  I used 1.7.8.p3
- cpp-json https://github.com/eteran/cpp-json.  I used version 3.3.1

- my app_framework is no longer needed as Poco provides these facilities.

Since I have multiple versions of compilers and boost on my system and they are located in
non-standard places, there are some makefile variables which need to be set to point to
the versions being used. rpath linker directives are used to make sure the correct runtime libraries are used.

BOOSTDIR needs to point to the root of your Boost installation.  A likely value is /usr where the Boost 
libraries are in /usr/lib and includes are in /usr/include/boost

GCCDIR needs to point to the root of your gcc installation. Again, a likely value is /usr where
g++ is in /usr/bin and headers are in /usr/include.

To build a release version do:
 make CFG=Release

To build a debug version do:
 make  (this defaults CFG to Debug)
